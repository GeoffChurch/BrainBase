# BrainBase
Platform for running and interfacing with neural networks.

No optimization algorithms are included at this point.

The current configuration is a C Elegans roundworm connectome which asynchronously pings IP addresses generated from energy accumulations in the first 32 ventral/dorsal muscles. Positive responses to these pings trigger firing of the "food" neurons. This code is based on the work of Timothy Busbice (github.com/Connectome/GoPiGo) and Gabriel Garrett (github.com/ggaabe/GoPiGo).
